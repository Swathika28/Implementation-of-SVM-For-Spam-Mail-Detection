# Implementation-of-SVM-For-Spam-Mail-Detection

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import the necessary packages.
2. Read the given csv file and display the few contents of the data.
3. Assign the features for x and y respectively.
4. Split the x and y sets into train and test sets.
5. Convert the Alphabetical data to numeric using CountVectorizer.
6. Predict the number of spam in the data using SVC (C-Support Vector Classification) method of SVM (Support vector machine) in sklearn library.
7. Find the accuracy of the model.

## Program:
